                <li>Onion powder</li>
                <li>Paprika</li>
                <li>Italian Seasoning, alot of it</li>
                <li>Bouillon</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside, keeping 1/2 cup of the pasta water for later use.</li>

                    <li>Sauté the aromatics: In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and chopped onion, sautéing for about 2-3 minutes until soft and fragrant.</li>

                    <li>Cook the veggies: Add the sliced zucchini, bell peppers, and mushrooms to the pan. Sauté for 5-7 minutes until the vegetables are tender. If using spinach or kale, toss it in toward the end, allowing it to wilt down.</li>

                    <li>Create the sauce base: Lower the heat and add the tomato paste to the pan, stirring it through the veggies. Cook for 1-2 minutes to let the tomato paste deepen in flavor.</li>

                    <li>Add the cream cheese: Stir in the softened cream cheese until it melts into the tomato paste and vegetables, forming a creamy mixture. Slowly pour in the milk to help thin the sauce to your desired consistency.</li>

                    <li>Season the sauce: Season generously with salt, pepper, red pepper flakes (if you want spice), garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and a lot of Italian seasoning. Add a bouillon cube or bouillon powder for extra depth. Stir everything together, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>

                    <li>Combine with pasta: Toss the cooked pasta into the sauce, mixing everything thoroughly. If the sauce is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up.</li>

                    <li>Finish and serve: Sprinkle the grated Parmesan cheese on top, adjusting the amount to your preference. Let the pasta simmer for 1-2 minutes, then serve hot, garnished with more Parmesan if desired. Enjoy!</li>
