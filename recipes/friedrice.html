         <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
         <p>Fried rice is one of my go-to dishes when I want something quick, easy, and packed with flavor. It’s the perfect way to use up leftover rice and whatever veggies or protein you have on hand. Whether it’s chicken, shrimp, or just eggs, everything gets tossed together in a hot pan with soy sauce and garlic, giving it that savory, slightly crispy finish. It’s super customizable and works great as a main dish or a side, depending on what you’re in the mood for.</p>

         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 cups cooked and cooled rice (preferably day-old)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 cup mixed vegetables (peas, carrots, corn)</li>
                <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
                <li>1/2 cup cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu (optional)</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
                <li>2 green onions, sliced (for garnish)</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the ingredients: Make sure your rice is cooked and cooled, ideally using leftover rice. Chop the vegetables, onion, and garlic. Beat the eggs in a small bowl and set aside.</li>

                    <li>Heat the oil: In a large pan or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium-high heat.</li>

                    <li>Cook the eggs: Pour the beaten eggs into the pan and scramble until cooked through. Once done, remove the eggs from the pan and set aside.</li>

                    <li>Sauté the vegetables: Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the pan and sauté the garlic and onions until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Add the mixed vegetables and cook for another 2-3 minutes until tender.</li>

                    <li>Add the rice: Stir in the cooled rice, breaking up any clumps. Cook for 3-4 minutes, allowing the rice to fry and develop a slight crisp.
                    </li>

                    <li>Add proteins: If using cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu, toss them into the pan at this stage and stir to combine.</li>

                    <li>Season: Add the soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and pepper. Stir to distribute the flavors evenly.</li>

                    <li>Combine eggs: Add the scrambled eggs back into the pan and mix everything together.</li>

                    <li>Garnish and serve: Top the fried rice with sliced green onions and serve hot.</li>
                </ol>
