         <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
         <p>These Mexican-style country potatoes are my go-to when I want something super flavorful but easy to make. They’re crispy on the outside, soft inside, and loaded with sautéed onions, bell peppers, tomatoes, and a little kick from serrano peppers. I love the smoky vibe from the paprika and cumin, and the fresh herbs just bring it all together. Whether I’m having them for breakfast or as a side for dinner, these potatoes always hit the spot!</p>
         <p>Blah blah blah</p>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>4 tomatoes, diced (or 1 can diced tomatoes)</li>
                <li>1-2 serrano peppers, finely chopped (adjust for spice level)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
                <li>2 cups water or vegetable broth</li>
                <li>Tortillas or crusty bread for serving</li>
               
            </ul>
        
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sauté the veggies: In a large pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes until softened. Add the minced garlic and serrano peppers, cooking for another minute until fragrant.</li>

                    <li>Make the sauce: Add the diced tomatoes to the pan and cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally until the tomatoes break down and form a thick sauce. Season with cumin, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Pour in the water or vegetable broth and bring to a simmer.</li>

                    <li>Poach the eggs: Once the sauce is simmering, crack the eggs directly into the sauce, making small wells for each egg. Cover the pan with a lid and let the eggs cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny (or cook longer for firmer yolks).</li>

                    <li>Serve: Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve the huevos ahogados with warm tortillas or crusty bread for dipping. Enjoy this delicious and comforting dish while it’s hot!</li>
